This is an xorg config file for the BIGtrack or Crayola PC Trackball.

For some people, the trackball may be easier to use if the buttons are placed on the bottom (like a more traditional trackball), rather than the top (Mickey Mouse style).  This requires a few options to be set in the xorg file to allow for this.  

The configuration also includes scrollwheel emulation when the right-mouse button is held.

This config is written for the older serial-only model, using a serial-to-usb adapter and inputattach --mouseman. 
This will cause the Identifier to be "Logitech M+ Mouse".  
Change this if you are connecting a newer model using USB or a PS/2 adapter.

To use:
On Ubuntu with X11, place this file in:
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d

and reboot.
